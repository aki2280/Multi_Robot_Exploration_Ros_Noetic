# Multirobot Turtlebot3 Simulation Exploration based on RRT for Ubuntu 20.04 ROS Noetic
This package is a compilation of the RRT package in a much complete package rather than figuring map merging and other function from other resipotary. 
This would serve as a self-contained package for the exploration module using simulation for the turtlebot.
This is tested on buntu 20.04.03LTS with ROS Noetic.

**Portion of the code with Python 2 has been updated to Python 3.**
**Note that the outcome might differ than the original calculation but should be approximately identical.**

## Requirements
The following code is exectuted in ROS Melodic in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

The following libraries are required to install before proceeding to run the code

    $ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gmapping
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-navigation
    $ sudo apt-get install python-opencv
    $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
    $ sudo apt-get install python-scikits-learn
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-teb-local-planner
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-multirobot-map-merge



## Add in Amazon Map
add in the amazon world map by executing the following comments:

    $ cd ~/catkin_explore/src
    $ git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-small-house-world.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/aws-robotics/aws-robomaker-bookstore-world.git
    $ cd ~/catkin_explore/
    $ catkin_make
    

## Execution for Single Robot
The program can be executed using the following comments in three terminal:

Terminal 1

     # roscore 
Terminal 2

     # source ~/catkin_explore/devel/setup.bash 
     # export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
     # roslaunch ros_multi_tb3 single_tb3_house.launch
Terminal 3

     # source ~/catkin_explore/devel/setup.bash 
     # export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
     # roslaunch rrt_exploration single_robot.launch 

## Execution for Multirobot
The program can be executed using the following comments in three terminal:

Terminal 1

     # roscore 
Terminal 2

     # source ~/catkin_explore/devel/setup.bash 
     # export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
     # roslaunch ros_multi_tb3 multiple_tb3_house.launch 
Terminal 3

     # source ~/catkin_explore/devel/setup.bash 
     # export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
     # roslaunch rrt_exploration three_robots.launch 



## Exploration Process
The exploration relies on the correct sequence else rendering with no goal for each of the robot.
1. Top Left
2. Bottom Left
3. Bottom Right
4. Top Right
5. Initial Point
 ![Instruction](/instruction2.png)
 Things to note: 5th initial point should be within the known map or preferable close to the robot starting point. 
 
 
## Saving Map
Save the map for single robot using the following command:

    # rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap map:=/tb3_0/map
    
    
Save the map for multirobot using the following command:

    # rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap map:=/map
    
    
## How to speed up Gazebo
- Try to download the [online models](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models) and put inside "~/.gazebo/models/" folder 
- Try not run a lot process in the background (simulation is cpu intensive)
- RVIZ might take up some of the computing power, can try to drop some topic if needed.

## known issues
1. the map merging will shift a lot if the slam drifting too severe.
2. shifting causing the frontier point remains even after explored.
3. sometimes robots will take some time to move to new plan.
4. The revenue function is awkwardly computing large negative value and hence the navigation cost seem insignificant. (inherited from the original RRT exploration)
5.  assignment of the goal is not close to suboptimal. May need to perform optimization on the goal allocation.
6.  some may encounter deadlock for robots in some map due to suboptimal configuration of the robot.
7.  some calculation might be differ than the original as there are some changes in the algorithm in midst of changing the script from python 2 to python 3.
